    "For this lab on exploring image data, our group chose a dataset called [The Best Artworks of All Time,](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) which is comprised of various pieces from 50 artists that the creator suggested as the most influential of all time. In addition to the images of these paintings, the dataset also includes data on each of the artists, such as the genre(s) or artistic movement that they were associated with, their nationality, a brief biography scraped from wikipedia, and the number of their paintings included in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most exciting opportunities for this dataset would be classifying images by artist or genre through geometric patterns and/or colors. For example, we would be able to upload a picture (not from one of the 50 artists) and run it through our model to determine which artist it is most similar to. Alternatively, we could determine the genre that the picture is the closest to, such as Expression or Surrealism. This would be very interesting to the artistic community; for example, a fine arts department at a university could use our model in order to analyze their students work and determine which well-known artist their work is most similar. Our model could also be used to determine the similarity of the artists in the dataset and to what degree of confidence from clustering in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model could be tested with other works of art by these 50 artists that are not included in the dataset. Additionally, it could be tested against different artists that were widely considered to be a part of the same genre. To be of interest to the artistic and educational communities however, our model would have to perform fairly well. Although difficult to quantify performance, we would desire a high degree of confidence or percentage similarity between two pieces. Although art is largely subjective, our model may be a way to study art more deterministically and numerically. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the base similarity result, the reasoning between the model's prediction may need to be given to be of use to the artistic community. For example, knowing that a student's painting is similar to a work by Dali may not be helpful in of itself, unless they know that this is based on the use of certain geometric patterns, etc."
